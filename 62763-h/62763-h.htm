<p><span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span> is distinctive among all the Bibelots.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Footlights</span>,
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It is a delightfully keen little swashbuckler.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Echo</span>,
Chicago.</p>

<p>The latest of the Bibelots. In my opinion it is the only one
of the lot, including the &#8220;Chap-Book,&#8221; &#8220;Philistine,&#8221; etc.,
which knows what it is driving at. The editor of the &#8220;Chap-Book&#8221;
toddles along, following or attempting to follow, the
twists and turns of the public taste&mdash;at least that is what he
wrote in a Note not long ago&mdash;and the editor of the &#8220;Philistine&#8221;
curses and swears, and devastates the atmosphere, trying his
best to kill everything. &#8220;<span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span>&#8221; at once impressed
me that Mr. Harte knows what he wants, and seriously intends
to have it. I hope he will.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The North American</span>, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It will pay any one who wishes to keep up with the literary
procession to peruse this sprightly little periodical.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Examiner</span>,
San Francisco, Cal.</p>

<p>That bright little bundle of anecdote, comment, essay, poetry
and fiction, &#8220;<span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span>,&#8221; of Boston, comes out in particularly
good style. It gives rich promise of many good things
to come.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Commercial Advertiser</span>, New York.</p>

<p>Number two of Walter Blackburn Harte&#8217;s dainty monthly
&#8220;<span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span>,&#8221; is out, and filled with the spirit of youth
and beauty in literature, and zealous with culture, taste and
faith toward higher ideals, it is going about doing good.</p>

<p>Mr. Harte is strong, brilliant and brave as an essayist of the
movement, and is making friends everywhere. The poetry and
prose is all of high merit.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Boston Globe.</span></p>

<p>The thing I like about Mr. Harte is his splendid spirit of
Americanism, his optimistic belief in native literature and native
writers; his hatred of all things bordering on toadyism or servile
flattery of foreign gods to the exclusion of home talent. This is
the key-note of <span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span>, and Mr. Harte will be apt to
say some trenchant, candid and always interesting things in its
pages.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Union and Advertiser</span>, Rochester, N. Y.</p>

<p>These are a few criticisms of the first two numbers, selected
from a great heap of enthusiastic notices. <span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span> is
promoting a Campaign for the Young Man in Literature. All
the young men and women in America are discussing its unique
and original literature, and spreading its fame.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE APOTHEOSIS OF THE HARLOT
IN THE PASSING SHOW.</h2></div>


<p>I am well aware that the true lover of books
is too wise to take a one idea&#8217;d bigot of a reformer
to his cosy fireside. I therefore preface
my observations under this somewhat alarming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
caption with an assurance that I am inspired
by no visionary enthusiasm to turn aside the
course of human nature.</p>

<p>These few notes deal with certain superficial
aspects of the general consciousness, as molded
and modified by the social, civil and moral influences
of our time. They show certain forces
incident to the development of some measure of
mental life in the mass. They are not made in
any spirit of arrogant ascetism, or in the hope
of radically mending the everyday morals of
mankind by precept or persuasion. The morals
of mankind are already under the care of a certain
apostolic succession, that with great wisdom
has substituted faith for morality as better suited
to the constitution of human nature. These enlightened
trustees of infallible revelation are
ably reinforced by a great many reformers, and
they need no support from profane literature.
Indeed the professional moralists find extremely
good picking in the widespread hallucination
that presents morality in the fascinating form
of a rabid curiosity about the doings of others.
They rather resent scientific criticism, and I
shall never intrench upon the workers in this
field, alluring as are all impossible reforms to
me, so long as there is any sort of following for
common sense. But I think certain psychological
forces at work in the swelter of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
century-end are worthy of some sort of record;
and at this moment I am thinking exclusively
of American conditions and phases, which are
the least likely to find an historian, and not of
Max Nordau&#8217;s pictures of contemporary Europe.</p>

<p>There is so much pinching of the spirit done
in the name of morality that it is not surprising
that some who care most for the spiritual side
of life view all moral propagandas with some disfavor.
In these few pages I simply wish to
make a plea for a little sweetness and sanity
from the Epicurean standpoint. Among the
grossest satyrs the ideal concerns of the intellect
and imagination often find their most inspiring
welcome, while among moralists and
reformers of human nature they are regarded
with indifference or open animosity. For this
reason it is important that a well defined distinction
should be made in the reader&#8217;s mind
between the claims of simple sanity and the absurd
dreams of perfectibility which form the insensate
ambition of moralists. The aims of
literature can never be those of reform.</p>

<p>Every generous mind is impelled at some time
or other to try to wholly mend or end the perversities
of human nature, but, in spite of the
faith and example of the saints and martyrs, a
few years&#8217; experience shows the folly of it. The
folly of a Utopian moralist and reformer is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
greater than the folly of the mob itself. Even
the old Hebrew prophets, with all their fine
fury and mystical reliance on the arm of Jehovah,
and their undoubted leadership and influence,
failed to lessen the potent and eternal
allurement of carnal pleasure and indulgence
one jot or tittle. The world has grown too old
for any but mad persons to dream of combatting
those evils which are inevitable in the constitution
of things. But since nearly all the consolations
of life are not inherent in human nature
but are the painful conquests of the mind, are,
in a word, artificial creations of man&#8217;s own subjective
life, and not at all incident to the ordinary
course of life in a wild and natural state,
we must strive to maintain a distinction between
the interests of the imagination and intellect,
and the concerns of everyday human nature.</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, in any intolerant spirit
that would deny the inevitableness of the carnal
life that I touch upon &#8220;The Apotheosis of the
Harlot.&#8221; I simply wish to show, in the broadest
and most liberal temper, that even the most
inevitable and legitimate passion of humanity
must be kept restrained within bounds, or the
whole of human life forfeits its hope and dignity
and purpose. Nature can parody herself in the
excess of madness. The sanity of human life,
social institutions, and all intellectual activity is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
imperilled when the passions of the blood, and
especially passions perverted, obtain an exaggerated
dominance over the emotions and passions
of the mind. That there is a decided drift
toward this ascendancy of the Pander and the
Harlot in the social and intellectual life of modern
democracy, is beyond all sort of doubt, and
cannot be blinked by any clear minded and untainted
observer. That is, any observer who is
not in fee of one of these gigantic enterprises
which flourish upon the epidemic of mediocrity.
There is an odd and strange obliquity of moral
vision that accompanies optimism professed as
a probable investment in the follies of the
credulous.</p>

<p>Of course the triumph of the Harlot in great
affairs and destinies is nothing new. She has
swayed courts and kings and empires from antiquity,
and there is no moral force in human
society that can ever disturb this firmly established
and most stable of all human institutions.
Dynasties totter, empires fall into ruins, religions
decline, philosophies shrivel to empty
names, nations perish and their history is lost,
civilization advances or decays, but the Harlot
plays her fateful part in the destinies of the race.
She is almost as important a factor in molding
the purpose and character of humanity as the
mother. Her potent and unassailable dominion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of the minds of men is due to the eternal fantasy
of human passion, and whatever may be the prevailing
code of morals, she will hold her sway
of wreck and ruin to the end of time. To rail
against an institution so inherent in the constitution
of human affairs is sheer folly. Indeed,
it may be almost said to be flying in the face of
Providence, since the only providence which we
know to be effective in this world is the unfailing
crookedness of human nature.</p>

<p>This view of Providence in human affairs
makes turning on Providence a less heinous offence
than the phrase suggests to some with
minds in pawn; and there are always some idealists
ready to oppose human nature itself, in rash
dreams of the conquest of life for love and
beauty and the spirit. It is not the eternal
witchery and potency of the Harlot I wish to
emphasize in this place, for that needs no argument,
but the fact that with the progress of
modern democracy this ancient institution,
hitherto confined within the limits of civic life,
the court and political affairs, has suddenly
loomed up as the one great overshadowing fact
and potency of human existence. And so in
spite of my parade of common sense and sanity
I may be held to be an impossible idealist in
many quarters, for I am opposing my own individual
tastes and those of a small minority, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the overwhelming tide of human nature. I find
the reign of the Harlot irksome&mdash;especially in
the distractions of literature and the theatre.</p>

<p>Some sort of parity has hitherto been maintained,
for a period of historical development, between
human nature in its unbridled enjoyment
of sensation, and those concerns of the intellectual
life, which have been the occupation and
solace of the few, to whom the pleasures of artifice
have grown more necessary than those of
sense, and, in moments of clearness and calm,
dearer than life itself. With the progress of
modern democracy, ordinary human nature has
sought factitious and unusual excitements, and
plunged into a course of sophistication. It has
insidiously encroached upon this realm of artificial
delights of the intellect, which the aliens
of the race have painfully wrested from life and
nature. The Harlot astride Pegasus is the end
of popular education.</p>

<p>The authority of religion and the force of
superstition, which for centuries kept the arts
and literature somewhat remote from the common
ideals and passions of the mass of men,
have declined, and with their eclipse the ideals
of the great mass of vulgar appetites have grown
with social freedom and popular education, until,
at this hour, we see the greatest tyranny of history
established, of which the Triumphant Harlot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
is the head and front and fitting symbol. It
is the pitiless despotism of the millions of uplifted,
cruel, greedy maws that hold the fateful
pence that decide every question of life and
thought in this age of enlightenment. Every
clod&#8217;s dirty penny or vote counts for as much as
a head full of brains. It is a sublime spectacle.
It is not the fact of the prosperity of the Harlot
in democracy which is at all remarkable, for of
course she has not depended upon societies or
governments, but upon human nature for her
queenship; it is the glorification of her arts and
her power, in the open prostitution of the printing
press in her honor and worship, the deification
of her calling and character in the popular
imagination, the dedication of the theatres solely
to her exploitation, and the trafficking in her person
and perversities, which is the stock in trade
of the picture periodicals devoted to the edification
of the millions&mdash;these things are not only
maddening and nauseating, but they belong distinctly
and peculiarly to this end of the century.
It is a form of insane sex worship which is destitute
of every vestige of glamor, of poetry, of
real excuse in nature. It is a grotesque parody
of all the beauty and dignity of human life. It
is the grim and ironical ending of the emancipation
of the appetites of the millions, in the
thousand and one delusions of popular education.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Ancient religions included the glorification
of sex. But this is the exaltation of the
lowest type of humanity&mdash;the sexless Pander to
that grim disease of imagination which is peculiar
to our hypocrisy of ascetic morality.</p>

<p>In the hourly prints of the day we pick up, at
every turn in the city, on hoardings, on every
theatre bill board, in the shop windows&mdash;everywhere
the triumphant, glorious and illustrious
Harlot of the day or season, in one of her many
roles, as dancer, actress, singer, society woman,
erotic novelist and the rest, confronts us in
her overwhelming and audacious supremacy of
finery, wealth, comfort and the adulation of the
community. We get her triumphs, her person,
her biographies, her lovers, her scandals, her
clothes and her character (these are all about
the same, too) with the painstaking detail of
sober history. Some of the queans, who have
discovered the secret of perpetual rejuvenation,
we cannot escape by any chance. These we
seem doomed to get forced upon us forever.
There may be great poets, great thinkers, great
philosophers and teachers in our contemporary
world, but there is no room for them in the tide
of current history-making or in the popular
interest and imagination. The glorified Harlot
alone is worthy to fill the mirror of the time;
she alone can warm the cockles of the heart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
democracy. It is for this that the great democracy
has mastered the three R&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Aspasia in the full noontide of the greatness
of Pericles, Lais just turned into the wonder of
the world in the marble of Appeles, and Phyrne
made immortal by Praxiteles as Venus rising,
rosy, nude and dishevelled from the sea, are
wantons who will ever hold the imaginations of
men enthralled. But it is certain that in the
very meridian of their glory, with poets, philosophers
and the greatest artists of history at
their feet, their fame never filled the narrow
confines of the ancient world as that of the
season&#8217;s kicking strumpet of the Music-hall fills
the modern world with its enlarged boundaries.
The fame and name of every fresh bawd from
the canaille is now cabled to the four corners of
the earth. The notorious harlot of each season&#8217;s
revels is the female Colossus of the modern
world. She is the goddess of the world of
traffic. There, aloft, above the reach of all
hungry, envious paupers, she rules and overshadows
two hemispheres with her legs astride.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A LITTLE COMMENTARY ON
CULTURED EUROPE.</h2></div>


<p>I wish some eminent psychologist and impartial
student of ineradicable racial traits would
calmly investigate the popular myth of an
&#8220;American&#8221; literature.</p>

<p>I valiantly insist upon the existence of literature
in America, but do not see much prospect
for an &#8220;American&#8221; literature.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>I wonder if the critics who are optimistic
about an &#8220;American&#8221; literature ever stop to
consider the fact that two-thirds of the people
who live in this country are of different stock
than ours, and different racial traditions and language.
Then they are from the depth of savagery.
They are illiterate and brutal, and possessed
of an unconquerable phlegm that cannot
tolerate such trivial, foolish things as the arts
and literature. Moreover, they are utterly out
of sympathy with the ideals of our race.</p>

<p>We often speak of Europe as the home of the
arts and their uplifting influences. It is true
enough, of course, but here is one of the ironies
of that old cradle of misery. This is only the
gloss of barbarism. How many Americans remember
Europe is also the home of the illiterate
and utterly incurable mob of low and bestial intelligences?
How many Americans, in thinking
of the low ebb of intellectual life here, ever
consider that a great deal of intellectual and
aesthetic interest and activity in this country,
among Americans of English descent, is smothered
and strangled by the popular pandering to
the appetites of an unassimilated mass of low
intelligences, only to be reached by coarse sensationalism
and vulgar prints?</p>

<p>We are recommended to go to Europe for
aesthetic training. We could get along much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
better with a sturdy stock of native observers, if
we could only keep out the hordes of ignorant
and degraded savages that flock here from every
hell-hole in Europe, and then spread like a great
itch throughout the country.</p>

<p>When one looks at the great blotches of ignorant
and inferior races which dot the map of the
United States in different industrial sections, one
wonders where and when an &#8220;American&#8221; literature
or &#8220;American&#8221; anything will come in.
Emigration is all right when it comes from the
right quarters, but the recent social history of
this country shows how it is absorbing the barbaric
scum of Europe.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PARILEE&#8217;S DREAM.</h2></div>



<p class="center">&#8220;Dreams are true while they last, and do we not live in
dreams?&#8221;</p>


<p>Her husband turned on his pillow and looked
at her. She was asleep, and the smiles that
played over her features, now and again interrupted
by a look of gentle sadness, showed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
she was dreaming. He was about to wake her,
but he hesitated to break in upon what he knew
must be a very sweet vision, and, keeping his
eyes upon her face, he awaited the end.</p>

<p>They had been married two years. He had
come suddenly into her life, taking her away
from several admirers and out of a continuous
round of pleasure and excitement, and after a
short courtship they had wed. Parilee often
said to herself: &#8220;How much better off I am,&#8221;
and thought with satisfaction that instead of
being a silly and superficial girl she was a wife,
and at the head of a home. There had been
hardly a discord in their lives since the day of
their union; and Parilee believed she was quite
happy.</p>

<p>As she lay there, her lips moved in the words,
&#8220;I love you,&#8221; and her face flushed so deeply that
her husband, doubting his eyes, speculated as
to whether she was really asleep.</p>

<p>As the early light of the sun burst into the
room, she started up, thinking, &#8220;What a dream
for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>At her old home she had wandered along by
the creek which ran through her father&#8217;s fields.
She had been in quest of something, but what
that something was she did not know; there
was a longing and a longing, very deep and sad.
Suddenly she had seen Tom Harding coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
toward her. Taking him by the hand, she had
led him to a large rock near, and they had both
sat down upon it. Then, in a trembling voice
she had said: &#8220;Tom, I&#8217;ve been seeking you such
a long time; I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking at her searchingly and with tenderness,
Tom had replied, oh, so softly; &#8220;You love
me! I have long loved you, too&#8221;; and had
taken her in his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you dreaming about?&#8221; her husband
asked, as she stirred and opened her eyes;
&#8220;I saw you smiling in your sleep.&#8221; She did not
answer, but went over her dream again and
again, recalling every minute detail. Sweeter
sensations never lingered after a real kiss. She
revelled in memory as she looked out on the
morning sky and thought of Tom&#8217;s embrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you dreaming of me, Parilee?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated, thinking: &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell him of
my dream; it was not such a thing as a wife
would want to repeat to her husband. Perhaps
I ought to tell him, though. No, it will not be
best; he would be displeased. I would better
let him think that his surmise is correct than to
make him sad or jealous. Besides, I am not responsible
for what happens in my sleep. If the
dream had included a thought or recognition of
Harry, I should think that I was harboring improper
feelings. But it was only a dream.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, Harry, I was dreaming of our old lover
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>When her husband started for his office he
gave Parilee his accustomed farewell kiss. To
him it was the same as usual, but to her it
seemed slightly insipid; the dream kiss was still
upon her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is because we have been married so long;
I have grown used to him,&#8221; she reasoned when
left alone. &#8220;I love Harry, and always shall.&#8221;
Then she sat down by the window, looked far
away into space, and went over the dream again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder where Tom is now,&#8221; she questioned
in her thought. &#8220;Probably married by
this time.&#8221; A disagreeable feeling went to her
heart. &#8220;He loved me before I met Harry.
What changes time brings.&#8221; And she mused
on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BUBBLE AND SQUEAK.</h2></div>


<p>The great books teach us to smile at life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The old proverb that there is nothing new
under the sun gives much latitude to dullards
and plagiarists, who are altogether destitute of
the fascination of a mood or manner. Egoism
is the last virtue of modern literature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not so much what a man says, but what
he looks, with women. It is the fantasy of
wickedness that flashes from eye to eye among
dumb clods that keeps poetry perennially in the
world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the sun shone only upon the righteous, he
would not need to get up so early in the morning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>I have my livelihood to earn, and consequently
I am an optimist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is something intellectually lacking in
all converts to brand new dogmas and creeds.
A deep sense of wickedness is but a phase of
immaturity of mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A woman who is not at heart a tyrant in her
dreams of love is a perversion of nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far as can be learned at this distance, there
is only one industry in the new South which is
really in a flourishing condition, and that is the
unlimited production of abominable trashy &#8220;literature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If some half baked people would consent to
go to night school instead of covering endless
reams with horrible aberrations, the progress of
aesthetics would be more rapid in America.
Some people cannot realize that mere mellifluous
meanderings in verse or plain prose are
simply indications of an affection of the gray
matter, akin to a cold in the head, and are
of no more significance to the outside world
than the week&#8217;s washing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instability of all industrial and business
life in America is one of the horrors of existence
here, and it is one of the factors that make
culture impossible here. A nation on the jump
runs to &#8220;smartness&#8221; but not to intellect. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
is only one class in our society that enjoys stability,
and that is the Police. Whether we may
expect any aesthetic appreciation from this
quarter remains to be seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;To amuse respectable people,&#8221; said Moliere,
&#8220;what a strange task.&#8221; And God was good
enough to allow Moliere to live and write for
the Court of Louis XIV. It is a great privilege
for a writer to know precisely the follies and
moods of his audience. Moliere himself showed
how much appreciation of wit and sanity can
be cultivated in a court of folly. But how
can the most assiduous student of human nature
gauge the vagaries of taste in a democracy? The
amusing of respectable, and other people, is the
wreck of imagination and authorship in this
happy land of Educational Eclipse. Here, all are
what is called &#8220;educated.&#8221; But how few care for
or know anything of that self education which
constitutes culture?</p>

<p>The poor alone trust in Providence. The rich
own Providence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Amaryllis</span>: As you did not enclose postage
for the return of your manuscript, I address
you through this medium. Your verses are
good enough from one point of view; but unfortunately
this is a Bibelot of Literature, and these
are picture-book verses. They are in the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
key, though, for we have tried them on the office
cat with gratifying results. The cat was seized
with a fit of melancholy, and has not been out
for two nights. It will be a sin if you do not
send these potent poems to the editor of the
<i>Century</i> magazine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The woman who has plenty of red blood corpuscles,
a body that is a body and not a poetic
wraith of the spirit, seems to be tumbling into
fiction nowadays. As the new heroine she is
rudely disturbing the reign of the pink and
white saints, expressly made in Paris dollhouses
for the heroines of English novels, who open
and close their eyes and smile in every chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Educate yourself to tell little lies easily and
artistically, and the big ones will take care of
themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trouble with the Anglo-Saxon bourgeois
is they have no picturesqueness. They have an
abundance of vices, but no redeeming ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The majority of men are Christians and pagans,
Democrats and Republicans, princes and
paupers, and what not, first of all, and themselves
last of all&mdash;usually only in crises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The salvation of stupidity in this world is that
the instinct of self-preservation has given it an
undisputed currency among the masses of men
as common-sense.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Democracy is the damnation of ideals. Old
John Calvin, if he were living and working out
his logic in the midst of modern life, would have
laid even greater distress upon total depravity
and the eternal damnation of the majority. That
is the only dream which can console us for the
dominion of the vulgar in this life; and, unfortunately,
there is no substantial logic or evidence
to support it. If instead of having lived
a quiet life in Geneva, in the sixteenth century,
Calvin were living to-day in the heart of New
York or Chicago, he would have made his theology
more terrible. The kernel of his doctrines
was evidently derived from the observation of human
society, and a career amid the brutality of
our modern cities would have left no room in his
creed for any compromises. The perseverance
of the saints is not in evidence in the cut-throat
scramble of modern life.</p>

<p>This doctrine of damnation has always condoned
for me many of the intolerable narrownesses
in Calvinism. If it is probable that God
himself cannot contemplate an invasion of the
mob without trepidation, I cannot see what
argument can be made in support of democracy
in our social and intellectual life here below. I
envy all those who hold this doctrine of damnation
without any troublesome doubts. Calvin
had evidently fathomed human nature, even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he did not enjoy any special revelation of the life
hereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>About the only woman whose novels I am
curious to read at this moment is Diana of the
Crossways. And her &#8220;Princess Egeria&#8221; and
the rest are out of reach forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now here is a nice psychological point. A
very clever woman, who knows men and women
as only some wonderful women can, and who
yet has never written a novel, came to me the
other day, as to a Father Confessor of the
smaller sophistries of conscience, upon which
religion affords no certain light and assurance.
The point she wished to know was whether she
was a new woman or simply a harmless flirt of
the old school. As I could not decide this momentous
matter, I concluded to ventilate it in
print, suppressing the name of my friend. The
situation is this: She loves her husband with
all her heart, but yet she sometimes lacks the
moral courage to tell some men whom she meets
casually that she is a married woman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It does not seem to add to England&#8217;s glory to
appoint Uriah Heep to the job of court clown.
The old jesters made better sport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder what peculiar influence
in their environment makes so many literary
critics attached to the editorial staff of periodicals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
whose chief staple is some denominational
form of religious conviction, so offensively positive
and dogmatic. They are seldom troubled
with any judicial hesitations. They proclaim
their ipse dixits with a solemnity and excess of asseveration
and finality which is hideously funny
to the lay mind, that takes its own peculiar predilections
and distastes, with a shade of something
approximating good-natured tolerance of
the possible tastes of others. I think this critical
attitude of the religious Pontifex is largely
due to some profound mental and moral confusion.
He is so accustomed to dealing out fire
and brimstone and damnation with a callous and
easy conscience to all who differ with him in the
domain of religious belief, and especially to
those who occupy the agnostic and rational attitude
toward the eternal problems of life, that he
finally gets into the trick of using the thunder
of Jehovah for smaller offences and occasions.</p>

<p>Here is a case in point. A solemn and inspired
lunatic writes, in the New York &#8220;Independent,&#8221;
of George Meredith, the greatest living writer in
the English speaking world, in this utterly mendacious
and injudicious fashion. &#8220;The most
elaborately feminine man in English literary
life.&#8221; &#8220;The Amazing Marriage&#8221; is then described
as &#8220;a crazy structure gorgeously decorated,
in which dwell nympholepts, aged satyrs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
erotic wives and foredoomed maidens, all moving
on to rainbow-hued destruction or jaundiced
delight.&#8221;</p>

<p>This in a religious paper that makes a great
parade of its dignity, and is always finding fault
with the <i>honest opinions</i> of others, because they
are apt to be so <i>irreverent</i>, looks like that simple
and vulgar bid for pre-eminence in heresy,
which will always catch the greedy ears of the
envious and mediocre mob, that is glad to see
hateful superiority spattered with mud. I suppose
this view of the modern man of letters
who is inflexibly true to his aims and the dignity
of his calling, and who is, moreover, the
master of his craft, is to be attributed to the superintellectual
quality of the inspiration that directs
all organs of religious opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a little hard to understand the criticism
which hails the revival of the old familiar blood
and thunder fiction of our boyhood days as the
renaissance of genius in fiction. All this sort of
literature, whether wrapt in mediæval properties
or not, is fatally melodramatic and unreal, and
constitutes so much lumber and nothing else,
if it should remain in the memory. But as all
our picture periodicals and Sunday papers are
filled with nothing but blood and thunder stuff
from Stanley Weyman, Anthony Hope and the
rest, it is obviously the taste of the time. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
meditating a new magazine on these popular
lines. It is to be called: &#8220;The Antique Renascence;
a Magazine of Pistol Shots and Rape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the metropolitan Sunday papers advertises
every week in triumphant and gigantic
capitals how many square miles of spruce forest
were converted into paper for the Sunday edition.
The number of square miles of forest that
is disappearing in this way is something appalling.
It seems to a few reactionary wits, unintoxicated
with the spectacle of this modern progress,
that sacrificing half a spruce forest to
make a Sunday paper is much worse than
butchering a little chain-gang of Christians to
make a Roman holiday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a simple death notice in the Boston <i>Evening
Events</i>, for February 2, 1896. It reads thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Priscilla Prim, of 29976 Beacon street,
Boston, died suddenly of a severe mental shock
yesterday evening. Miss Prim was well known
as the possessor of a very large fortune, a philanthropist,
and a patron of the arts and all sorts
of moral reforms and missions, and her decease
will be mourned by all lovers of liberal culture.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had just finished her supper, when a niece
from Chicago, who was stopping in her house,
to come out this season in the &#8220;smart set,&#8221;
handed her a copy of the February <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span>,
fresh and virgin from the press that evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
It contained some opinions which are regarded
as heterodox and impossible in &#8220;The Ladies&#8217;
Own Humbug and Treasury of Misinformation.&#8221;
It appeared to lack reverence for the unsupported
tradition of &#8220;culture&#8221; that lingers in modern
materialistic, money-grubbing Boston, in
every well-regulated household, quite independently
of the fact that in thousands there is no
evidence of civilization in the shape of books,
ancient or modern. This flippancy is undoubtedly
immoral, and its heinousness may be judged
by its effect in this instance.</p>

<p>Miss Prim was mad, indignant, furious, and
fumed at the mouth with the passion of her outraged
moral feelings. She sprang to her feet to
write a letter of protest to the editor of the
<i>Events</i>, when she stumbled over the only work
of literature in the establishment&mdash;it was Mrs.
Parloa&#8217;s Appledore Cookbook, by the way&mdash;and
falling face forward upon the floor, she expired
immediately of a severe bump and excess
of moral emotion.</p>

<p>It is time the old fierce Puritanical spirit was
calmed in the blood of the hereditary Bostonians;
but the old generation dies glum and
hard, and will refuse Heaven if the Almighty is
so captious as to demand a sense of humor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. Chauncey M. Depew is reported to have
said that Fame depends entirely upon being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
civil to interviewers. English visitors should
remember this&mdash;and a few, who want to feather
their nests, are beginning to appreciate the wisdom
of our worldly sage. Conan Doyle and
Hall Caine have taken &#8220;the tip,&#8221; and have even
been quite civil and polite about American institutions
and social life since gaining their own
shores. This little simple art of glossing is one
the British should cultivate. They are at present
the most hateful people on earth. The world
is getting crowded now and they should endeavor
to become less obnoxious. English
celebrities can extend their fame with their
courtesies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A very pathetic and significant incident occurred
in one of the leading hotels of Boston
the other day. It is fraught with a warning for
the injudicious, that needs no additional emphasis
from me. But do not turn aside and
skip the paragraph because it has <i>a moral</i>!</p>

<p>A well-known Temperance lecturer and social
reformer from Shebogan Falls, Arizona, who
was stopping at the house, was suddenly taken
violently sick, and showed unmistakable signs
of suffering from delirium tremens. The gentleman
had then been in the hotel for twenty-four
hours and he was known to have touched
no liquor. A search of his room and grip revealed
no intoxicants. The doctors called in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
were positive about the symptoms, and yet the
man&#8217;s breath contained no hint of alcohol. The
stomach pump afforded no more confirmation.
But he was in the throes of delirium tremens,
nevertheless, and the doctors were perplexed.
All sorts of elaborate theories of hereditary influences
were proposed and discussed, and the
man&#8217;s history and ancestry were looked up.
Suddenly he recovered, and an explanation was
soon forthcoming.</p>

<p>A well thumbed and dismantled copy of the
<span class="smcap">Arena</span> magazine was discovered under his bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those who are interested in the diffusion of
good literature among all classes in America,
should make themselves acquainted with the
publications of Thomas B. Mosher, of Portland,
Me. A good book in his list to put upon the
shelf, to begin with, is the beautifully bound
volume of the Bibelot for 1895. In making a
collection of belles-lettres, the authors and
books after all, who give most pleasure, one
provides a sure refuge always at hand for any
sudden invasion of the blues or ennui, and there
is solace here for weightier sorrows, too. For
the brave idealists condemned to struggle in
this alien world, who can still unpack their
minds of all sordid sorrows and bitterness and
carry merry and piping hearts to Arcady, are
surely not lacking in a profound philosophy&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the philosophy which includes the life of
the philosopher is rare indeed.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that the poets and fantastists
are closer to our moods through the changing
years than all other writers. When the historians,
philosophers and social prophets and
the rest find us indifferent and content to let
the world slide, when great names and ideals no
longer stir or move us, when experience has
disenchanted us with life and humanity, and so
stript history and philosophy and religion of all
significance, when all our enthusiasms are gone,
love is an exchange of domestic services for the
sake of economy, and friendship is a long laid
ghost of youth&mdash;then we can recur again and
again to the authors who turn our chimney corner
into that wider dominion of freedom the
human spirit can never quite relinquish in its
dreams. Fine spun logic and all the metaphysics
of the ages cannot bring us back to faith
and hope and charity then; but these few
blessed spirits who found their way to Arcady
occasionally, give us a spell of oblivion, if not
much philosophy, and often a pinch of fortitude
for our return to the doom of disenchantment.</p>

<p>The republic of beauty is not an important
territory or marked very clearly on the current
maps of Democracy. But there are still some
who cherish the ancient boon of poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and beauty, and such will appreciate a volume
like &#8220;The Bibelot,&#8221; filled with the literature
that blows through our foetid life like God&#8217;s
wind through a hospital. It is one of the few
books that cannot fail to hit the taste of any real
book lover. It contains selections from William
Blake, James Thomson, Francois Villon, a discourse
of Walter Pater&#8217;s on Marcus Aurelius,
Fragments from Sappho, Sonnets on English
Dramatic Poets, the Pathos of the Rose in
Poetry, extracts from Rossetti&#8217;s &#8220;Hand and
Soul,&#8221; Robert Louis Stevenson&#8217;s &#8220;A Lodging
for the Night: A Story of Villon,&#8221; and other
masterpieces of literature. It is a priceless
book for the poor student, for these selections
have been culled from scarce editions and
sources not generally accessible.</p>

<p>If our young readers will read the Bibelot,
they may acquire the sense of beauty and power
of discrimination, and the taste for the best in
literature, old and new. They will then become
callous to the tawdry domestic twaddle that has
been circulated as &#8220;literature&#8221; in the respectable
domestic periodicals, for the past two decades,
in this country, and will learn to distinguish
genuine literature from mere merchandise.
Perhaps then it will be possible for sincere
and earnest work to find currency in books
in America, as it has not been since the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
picture periodicals took the place of books in our
breakneck economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anthony Hope is one of the few authors of
the day honest enough to confess that he reads
very little. He is too busy writing. This is
one of the evils of the age. The writers outnumber
the readers. Every man or woman who
takes to writing is a reader lost, for writers
almost invariably only read and reread their
own works. But all authors are not as candid
as Anthony Hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That volume of lectures on &#8220;The Art of Making
a Newspaper,&#8221; which all &#8220;the bright young
men&#8221; in American journalism have been studying,
is marred with the omission of an important
historical matter. This is the origin and
career of Mr. Dana&#8217;s &#8220;office cat.&#8221; Charles A.
Dana is the most picturesque personality in contemporary
American public life. He is more
definitely in the popular imagination of this
generation than any man engaged in literature
proper, and so every characteristic detail and
whimsy of the &#8220;Sun&#8217;s&#8221; school of journalism
should be recorded for the benefit of posterity.
The &#8220;office cat&#8221; has played a great part in the
&#8220;Sun&#8217;s&#8221; art and artifice, and its omission is a
national catastrophe.</p>

<p class="center">The Leading Critical Literary Journal of London,
in a long review of &#8220;<span class="smcap">Meditations in
Motley</span>,&#8221; by <span class="smcap">Walter Blackburn Harte</span>,
says, among other things:</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;When any book of good criticism comes it should be welcomed
and made known for the benefit of the persons who care
for such works. The book under notice is one of these. It is,
so far as I know, the first from the author&#8217;s pen; but his writings
are well known, and those who read his present book will, with
some eagerness, await its successor. For it is a book in which
wit and bright, if often satirical, humor are made the vehicle for
no flimsy affectations, but for genuine thought. Mr. Ruskin has
affirmed that the virtue of originality is not newness, but genuineness.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this true sense Mr. Harte&#8217;s book is original. Here is
his own thought on several topics, pleasantly displayed, and no
mere echo or second-hand production of the ideas of others. If
Mr. Harte continues to act up to this sentiment, [a long quotation
from the book under consideration] as he does in the present
book, he may not achieve the triumph of twentieth editions, but
he will be a power for good&mdash;as every true man of letters is, and
must be in the world. If it were practicable I should be much
disposed to let the author recommend himself by giving copious
quotations from these essays. At his best&mdash;that is, in his most
characteristic and seemingly unconscious passages&mdash;he reminds
one of Montaigne; the charming inconsequence, the egotism free
from arrogance.&#8221;</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
